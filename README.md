1) first impression on data set, data is clean and balanced.
2) there are various input features and output is a regression
3) i think we need to normalize the input features in order to eliminate bias while we perform feature engineering and ensure correctness.

regplot is best for checking linear relationship.
boxplot is best for comparing distributions by categories.
kdeplot is best for seeing how feature distributions shift with categories.
