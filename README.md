1) first impression on data set, data is clean and balanced.
2) there are various input features and output is a regression
3) i think we need to normalize the input features in order to eliminate bias while we perform feature engineering and ensure correctness.

regplot is best for checking linear relationship.
boxplot is best for comparing distributions by categories.
kdeplot is best for seeing how feature distributions shift with categories.

## here we have observed a key relation 
## previously we have derived a new feature that is ac_minus_volatile one it had moderate 0.52-0.53 with quality.
## but we have chose to move with different plan when i filtered the quality with max like 7-8 things changed. (it is just for the observation purpose)
## coor between ac_minus_volatile and quality decreased we have worked on it and observed.(we should train model with whole data)
## the narrow change between the quality like from 7-8 shows very little coorelation bet quality and new feature.
## so we have filtered the dataset with the 5-8 quality and observed the coorelation keenly.
## then we have realized that actually volatile acid has negative impact while rising with quality.
## so it showed strong coorelation when we minus volatile acid from alcohol the coor increased with quality.
## now we are observed that sulphate has 0.25 +ve impact on the quality when increasing.
## so we have decided to add it to the new feature to test impact.
